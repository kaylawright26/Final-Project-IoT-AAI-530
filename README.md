# Final-Project-IoT-AAI-530
The IOT file called 'IoT_Project_Final.ipynb' is our final version of this project. 
We used a traffic dataset to predict vehicle count at different junctions in a time sequence with an LSTM.
We also used different neural network methods to predict the junction location using the features in this dataset.
